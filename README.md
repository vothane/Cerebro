# Cerebro

A deep belief network (DBN) a type of deep neural network. Just an exercise 
to learn the inner workings of a deep learner. As of this writing everthing
pretty much works as it should. Just major code cleanup and refactoring to
make the code clean and easier to read. Also add some upgrades like adding
non-linearities between layers with RELUs and add the performance boosting
concept of dropouts.

I will use another repo to benchmark its performance with real life case
studies in another repo.
