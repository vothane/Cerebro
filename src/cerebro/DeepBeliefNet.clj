; A deep belief network is obtained by stacking several RBMs on top of each
; other. The hidden layer of the RBM at layer `i` becomes the input of the
; RBM at layer `i+1`. The first layer RBM gets as input the input of the
; network, and the hidden layer of the last RBM represents the output. When
; used for classification, the DBN is treated as a MLP, by adding a logistic
; regression layer on top.
